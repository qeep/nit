nit
===

The goal of the nit project is to provide a portable, small and
very-few dependecies any length unsigned integer library

However nit is not a high performance library,
if you need one of those you should have a look at gmp.

Features / Goals
----------------

* Be well documented
  Algorithms and data structers should be described in easy to understand terms.

* Very few dependencies
  At the moment the unly required dependencies are implementations of
  malloc, realloc and free.
  The examples and unit tests allso use the standard input/output functions.

* Portable
  All the code is written in clean C that should work out of the
  box on almost any platform.
  This ofcourse means nit is not very fast compared to other libraries.
